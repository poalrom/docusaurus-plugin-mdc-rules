# Related Test Rule

This is a related rule file that tests the cross-reference functionality of the plugin.

## Purpose

This file is referenced from [sample-rule.mdc](mdc:sample-rule.mdc) to test:

1. Internal cross-reference resolution
2. Link processing by the plugin
3. Navigation between rule pages

## Content

This rule demonstrates that the plugin can:

- Process multiple .mdc files
- Resolve internal links correctly
- Generate proper routes for linked content
- Maintain relationship context between files

## Back Reference

You can return to the main test file: [Sample Rule for Testing](mdc:sample-rule.mdc)

## Test Verification

When testing the plugin-component integration, verify that:

- Links between these files work correctly
- The plugin processes both files
- The RulePage component renders linked content properly
- Navigation maintains proper context
