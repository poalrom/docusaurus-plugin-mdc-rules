# Sample Rule for Testing

This is a sample rule file created to test the integration between the docusaurus-plugin-mdc-rules plugin and the RulePage component.

## Purpose

This file serves as a test fixture to verify that:

1. The plugin correctly processes .mdc files
2. The RulePage component receives proper props from plugin data
3. The component renders correctly with plugin-generated content

## Test Content

### Basic Markdown Features

This section tests basic markdown rendering:

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text* 
- `Code snippets`
- [External link](mdc:https:/example.com)

### Code Block

```typescript
interface TestInterface {
  name: string;
  value: number;
}

const testFunction = (param: TestInterface): void => {
  console.log(`Testing: ${param.name} with value ${param.value}`);
};
```

### Mermaid Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Plugin Processes .mdc] --> B[Generates Route]
    B --> C[RulePage Component]
    C --> D[Rendered Page]
    D --> E[User Sees Content]
```

### Cross-Reference Testing

This section would test internal links if other .mdc files existed:

- Link to another rule: [Related Rule](mdc:related-rule.mdc)

## Expected Behavior

When this file is processed by the plugin and rendered by the RulePage component, it should display:

1. **Metadata Panel**: Showing title, description, category, complexity, tags, and dates
2. **Content Area**: Rendering all markdown content with proper styling
3. **Mermaid Diagram**: Interactive diagram rendering
4. **Navigation**: Proper breadcrumbs and sidebar integration
5. **Theme Integration**: Consistent with Docusaurus theme styling

## Verification Points

- [ ] Frontmatter metadata displays correctly in component
- [ ] Markdown content renders with proper styling
- [ ] Mermaid diagram is interactive and properly styled
- [ ] Component integrates with Docusaurus theme
- [ ] Page routing works correctly
- [ ] CSS modules are loaded properly
